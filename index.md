Currently, I am a postdoctoral scientist with [Joshua Jacobs](https://jacobslab.bme.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University in New York. In the fall of 2023, I was a visiting scholar with [Lukas Kunz](https://spatialmemorylab.com/author/lukas-kunz-md-phd/) at the University of Bonn in Germany. I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Columbia in 2023. Prior to graduate school, I was a research assistant for Mouhsin Shafi at the [Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation](https://www.tmslab.org/) at the Harvard Medical School. I earned my BS in Biomedical Engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2015.
